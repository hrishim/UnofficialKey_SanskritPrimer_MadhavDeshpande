# Lesson 15

**1) Write past-imperfect 3rd-person forms (singular, dual and plural) for any thirty verbs with verbal prepositions**

Past-imperfect is लङ् लकारः  and preposition is उपसर्गः

**2) Translate the following sentences into English:**

१) कवीनाम् सभायाम् उपविशय सः नृपः एतस्य कवेः काव्यानाम् गुणान् पर्यैक्षत। काव्येषु गुणान् दृष्टवा प्रसन्नः सः नृपः एतस्मै कुशलाय कवये बहु धनम् प्रायच्छत्।

After sitting in the poet's congregation the king examined the quality of this poet's poems. After seeing the quality in the poems the happy king gave this skillful poet lot of wealth.

कवीनाम् सभायाम् उपविशय स नृप एतस्य कवेः काव्यानाङ्गुणान् पर्यैक्षत। काव्येषु गुणान् दृष्टवा प्रसन्नः स नृः एतस्मै कुशलाय कवये बहु धनम्प्रायच्छत्।

How is the word पर्यैक्षत formed? It means examined. It is from the verb ईक्षते (लट् लकारः आत्मनेपदी).

The लङ् लकार (past-imperfect) form is as follows:

अ + ईक्षते = आ + ईक्षत = ऐक्षत

For verbs with initial vowels, the combination of the past-tense अ with the initial vowel results in the वृद्धि of the initial vowel. See Lesson 11.

परि + ऐक्षत = पर्यैक्षत

**3) Rewrite the above Sanskrit Sentences with all known sandhis.**

Done above

**4) Translate the following sentences into Sanskrit, making all possible Sandhis. Whenever possible use the verbal preposition + verb forms contained in the vocabulary of this lesson.** (Use potential forms to translate English future until we learn the Sanskrit future forms in Lesson 17.)


## Notes

Sanskrit Grammarians enumerate the following prepositions:
प्र, परा, अप, सम् , अनु, अव, निस्, निर्, दुस्, दुर्, वि, आ, नि, अधि, अपि, अति, सु, उद्, अभि, प्रति, परि, उप।

These prepositions function in two distinct ways. Sometimes, they govern nouns and functions as **adverbial phrases**. In this kind of usage, they govern different cases of nouns. In this usage, the Sanskrit grammarians call them **कर्मप्रवचनीयः**.

These prepositions can also be directly attached to verb roots. This way they lead to the formation of a new combination, **which can have a distinct meaning**. In this function, these are called **उपसर्ग** by the Sanskrit grammarians.

**Note: When a उपसर्ग is attached to a verb the meaning could change completely. Also the way a उपसर्ग changes the meaning of one verb may not apply to another verb.**

English prepositions are words like in, at, on, of, and to. उपसर्ग and कर्मप्रवचनीयः are not the same. Why does Deshpande refer to them as prepositions?

| Verb | Meaning | Verb | Meaning | Verb | Meaning |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
| गच्छति | he goes | ईक्षते | he sees | हरति | he takes |
| आगच्छति | he comes | प्रतीक्षते | he awaits | आहरति | he brings |
| | | निरीक्षते | he observes | विहरति | he wanders |
| | | परीक्षते | he examines | | |

<br>
Two are three verbal prepositions may be simultaneously be prefixed to a verb:

| Word | Meaning | Prefixes (my interpretation) |
| --- | --- | --- |
| व्याहरति | he speaks | वि + आ + हरति |
| प्रत्यागच्छति | he returns | प्रति + आ + गच्छति |
| अनुव्याहरति | he repeats (someone's words) | अनु + वि + आ + हरति |

<br>
The past tense marker अ is always prefixed to the word before adding the verbal prepositions. So the sequence is always: preposition + अ + verb. Examples:

<br>

| Present tense with preposition | Meaning | Past tense with preposition | Meaning |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| प्रविशति | he enters | प्राविशत् | he entered |
| अनुगच्छति | he follows | अन्वगच्छत् | he followed |
| उत्खनति | he digs up | उदखनत् | he dug up |
| विहरति | he moves about | व्यहरत् | he moved about |

There are examples where the अ marker for past tense will not be "visible":

आ + गच्छति = आगच्छति (he comes)

आ + अ + गच्छत् = आगच्छत् (he came)

<br>

आ + हरति = आहरति (he brings)

आ + अ + हरत् = आहरत् (he brought)

Sometimes when उपसर्ग is added the word changes from आत्मनेपदि to परस्मैपदि :

रमते (he feels happy) --> विरमति (he desists, stops) (Also with आ, परि and उप)

तिष्ठति (he stands) --> सन्तिष्ठति (he stays, remains) (Also with अव, प्र, and वि)

जयति (he conquers) --> पराजयते (he defeats) (Also with वि)

गच्छति (he goes) --> सङ्गच्छते (he unites, meets with)

विशति (he enters) --> निविशते (he occupies)


**Words with उपसर्ग  have the affix य when applied to words with क्त्वा प्रत्यय:**

Example: गत्वा and आगत्य
