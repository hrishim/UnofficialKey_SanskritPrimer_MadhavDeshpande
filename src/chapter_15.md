# Lesson 15


## Notes

Sanskrit Grammarians enumerate the following prepositions:
प्र, परा, अप, सम्, अनु, अव, निस्, निर्, दुस्, दुर्, वि, आ, नि, अधि, अपि, अति, सु, उद्, अभि, प्रति, परि, उप।

These prepositions function in two distinct ways. Sometimes, they govern nouns and functions as **adverbial phrases**. In this kind of usage, they govern different cases of nouns. In this usage, the Sanskrit grammarians call them **कर्मप्रवचनीयः**.

These prepositions can also be directly attached to verb roots. This way they lead to the formation of a new combination, **which can have a distinct meaning**. In this function, these are called **उपसर्ग** by the Sanskrit grammarians.

**Note: When a उपसर्ग is attached to a verb the meaning could change completely. Also the way a उपसर्ग changes the meaning of one verb may not apply to another verb.**

English prepositions are words like in, at, on, of, and to. उपसर्ग and कर्मप्रवचनीयः are not the same. Why does Deshpande refer to them as prepositions?

| Verb | Meaning | Verb | Meaning | Verb | Meaning |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
| गच्छति | he goes | ईक्षते | he sees | हरति | he takes |
| आगच्छति | he comes | प्रतीक्षते | he awaits | आहरति | he brings |
| | | निरीक्षते | he observes | विहरति | he wanders |
| | | परीक्षते | he examines | | |

Two are three verbal prepositions may be simultaneously be prefixed to a verb:

| Word | Meaning | Prefixes (my interpretation) |
| --- | --- | --- |
| व्याहरति | he speaks | वि + आ + हरति |
| प्रत्यागच्छति | he returns | प्रति + आ + गच्छति |
| अनुव्याहरति | he repeats (someone's words) | अनु + वि + आ + हरति |

<br>
The past tense marker अ is always prefixed to the word before adding the verbal prepositions. So the sequence is always: preposition + अ + verb. Examples:

| Present tense with preposition | Meaning | Past tense with preposition | Meaning |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| प्रविशति | he enters | प्राविशत् | he entered |
| अनुगच्छति | he follows | अन्वगच्छत् | he followed |
| उत्खनति | he digs up | उदखनत् | he dug up |
| विहरति | he moves about | व्यहरत् | he moved about |
