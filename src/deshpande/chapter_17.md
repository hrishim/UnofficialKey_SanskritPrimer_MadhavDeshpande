# Lesson 17: Future tense: -स्य Future


In Sanskrit there are two kinds of future forms - periphrastic and non-periphrastic. The periphrastic form has tne infix तस् and the non-periphrastic has the infix स्य. Sanskrit grammarians consider the स्य future to be "genera future" and the तस् future to be "non-today". In classical language there is no such distinction. This section is only about the स्य future.

*periphrastic* - Constructed by using an auxiliary word rather than an inflected form. For example, "of father" instead of "father's"

The form:

Root + (often an augment इ) + स्य + present tense affixes

Examples: 

| | |
| --- | --- |
| He will be | सः भविष्यति। |
| I will go | अहं गमिष्यामि |
| He will fall | सः पतिष्यति |
| He will think | सः चिन्तयिष्यति |
| You will speak | त्वम् वदिष्यसि |

In some cases the स्य infix occurs without being preceeded by इ. For example, पास्यति (he/she will drink).
