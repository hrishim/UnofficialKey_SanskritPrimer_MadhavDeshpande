## Notes

In Sanskrit there are two kinds of future forms - periphrastic and non-periphrastic. The periphrastic form has tne infix तस् and the non-periphrastic has the infix स्य. Sanskrit grammarians consider the स्य future to be "genera future" and the तस् future to be "non-today". In classical language there is no such distinction. This section is only about the स्य future.

*periphrastic* - Constructed by using an auxiliary word rather than an inflected form. For example, "of father" instead of "father's"

The form:

Root + (often an augment इ) + स्य + present tense affixes

Examples: 

| | |
| --- | --- |
| He will be | सः भविष्यति। |
| I will go | अहं गमिष्यामि |
| He will fall | सः पतिष्यति |
| He will think | सः चिन्तयिष्यति |
| You will speak | त्वम् वदिष्यसि |

In some cases the स्य infix occurs without being preceeded by इ. For example, पास्यति (he/she will drink).

"Active and middle verbs" (middle = आत्मनेपदि) follow the active and middle present tense patterns in स्य future forms. For some middle verbs once can have optional active forms.  E.g. वर्तिष्यते and वत्स्र्यति. Another is मनिष्यति and मंस्यति.

For some active verbs one can have middle forms - गमिष्यति and गंस्यते. Passive forms are obtained by using the corresponding middle forms with स्य-infix.

Active Voice: रामः ग्रामं गमिष्यति। Rama will go to the village.

Passive Voice: रामेण ग्रामः गंस्यते। The village will be gone to by Rama.

For आत्मनेपदि (middle verbs) the active and passive future forms like alike. But the syntactic agreement between the agent, object, and the verb will be different in active and passive.

Example:

Active Voice: रामः वाक्यम् भाषिष्यते।
Passive Voice: रामेण वाक्यम् भाषिष्यते।
