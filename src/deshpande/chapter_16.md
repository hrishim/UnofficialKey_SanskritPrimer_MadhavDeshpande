## Notes

There are two kinds of passive voice in Sanskrit - कर्मणि प्रयोग and भावे प्रयोग

### Transitive Passive Voice - कर्मणि प्रयोग

In these sentences the object of the transitive action is the syntactic focus, and not the agent of the action.

The verb is conjugated like it is an आत्मनेपदि verb and a य is also added. So the combination is - verb root + य + affix. Here are some examples.

| Constituents | Verb | Meaning |
| --- | --- | --- |
| गम् + य + ते | गम्यते | is gone to|
| नी + य + ते | नीयते | is taken |
| जि + य + ते | जीयते | is won |
| गण् + य + ते | गण्यते | is counted |
| दा + य + ते | दीयते | is given |
| दृश् + य + ते | दृश्यते | is seen |

Note that the verbs undergo vocalic/consonantal changes in passive form. Examples: दा -> दी &nbsp; यज् -> इज् &nbsp; वद् -> उद् 

In कर्मणि प्रयोग the verb agrees with the कर्मन् (object) in number and person. The object of a passive action takes nominative form and the agent takes the instrumental case. Example:

| प्रयोग (Voice) | Sentence | Translation |
| --- | --- | --- |
| कर्तरि प्रयोग (Active voice) | रामो गृहम् गच्छति | Rama goes home |
| **कर्मणि प्रयोग** (Transitive Passive Voice) | रामेण गृहम् गम्यते | Home is gone to by Rama |
| कर्तरि प्रयोग (Active voice) | रामो भूमिम् खनति | Rama digs the ground |
| **कर्मणि प्रयोग** (Transitive Passive Voice) | रामेण भूमिः खन्यते | Home is gone to by Rama |

In the above examples the word गृहम्  when used in कर्तरि प्रयोग is in द्वितीया विभक्ति एकवचन. In the कर्मणि प्रयोग sentences is is  प्रथमा विभक्ति एकवचन (nominative).  

More examples:

| प्रयोग (Voice) | Sentence | Translation |
| --- | --- | --- |
| कर्तरि प्रयोग (Active voice) | अहम् पुत्रान् पश्यामि | I see (my) sons |
| **कर्मणि प्रयोग** (Transitive Passive Voice) | मया पुत्राः दृश्यन्ते | (My) sons are seen by me |
| कर्तरि प्रयोग (Active voice) | त्वम् भार्याम् स्मरसि | You remember (your) wife |
| **कर्मणि प्रयोग** (Transitive Passive Voice) | त्वया भार्या स्मर्यते | (Your) wife is remembered by you |

Note that all other items in the sentence, except adjectives of the object and the agent (and of course the verb), remain unaffected by the change in voice.


### Transitive Passive Voice (कर्मणि प्रयोग) in Past imperfect (लङ् लकार), imperative (लोट् लकार) and optative (लिङ् लकार) 

In these cases use the आत्मनेपदि (middle form) of the verb.

| प्रयोग (Voice) | Sentence | Translation | Tense |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| कर्तरि प्रयोग (Active voice) | त्वम् भूमिम् अखनः | You dug the ground | Past (लङ् लकार) |
| **कर्मणि प्रयोग** (Transitive Passive Voice) | त्वया भूमिः अखन्यत | The ground was dug up by you | Past (लङ् लकार) |
| कर्तरि प्रयोग (Active voice) | त्वम् भूमिम् खन | (You) dig up the ground | Imperative (लोट् लकार) |
| **कर्मणि प्रयोग** (Transitive Passive Voice) | त्वया भूमिः खन्यताम् | The ground must be dug by you. | Imperative (लोट् लकार) |
| कर्तरि प्रयोग (Active voice) |  त्वम् भूमिम् खनेः | You should dig the ground | Potential (लिङ् लकार) |
| **कर्मणि प्रयोग** (Transitive Passive Voice) | त्वया भूमिः खन्येत | The ground should be dug by you. | Potential (लिङ् लकार) |

<BR>

| प्रयोग (Voice) | Sentence | Translation | Tense |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| कर्तरि प्रयोग (Active voice) |  |  | |
| **कर्मणि प्रयोग** (Transitive Passive Voice) | | | |

**Note that all passive forms are identical with the forms of a 4<sup>th</sup> conjugation middle verb such as मन्**

### Intransitive Passive - भावे प्रयोग

In Sanskrit one can have an intransitive passive construction for any intransitive verb, and for transitive verbs used without objects. The focus of the construction is neither the agent, nor the object (which does not exist in this case anyway), but the action (भाव) itself. Thus intransitive constructions can be rendered into English as: 

- The action of going is done by Rama
- The action of going was done by my friends
- The action of eating should be done by the King

While strange in English, these sentences are frequent in Sanskrit and are often considered more polite than the corresponding active constructions.

In intransitive passive the agent takes the instrumental case (तृतीया विभक्ति) and **the passive verb is always in third person singular**.
